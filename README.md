# Supply_chain-analysis
 The supply Chain is the network of production and logistics involved in producing and delivering goods to customers. And Supply Chain Analysis means analyzing various components of a Supply Chain to understand how to improve the effectiveness of the Supply Chain to create 
 more value for customers.

## Supply Chain Analysis using Python
- Understand how data analysts and scientists gather and analyze data
- Perform data analysis in Python
- Combine, group, and aggregate data from multiple sources
- Create data visualizations with `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
- Use Python data science libraries to analyze real-world datasets.
- Use `pandas` to solve several common data representation and analysis problems
- Utilize computer science concepts and algorithms to write more efficient code for data analysis
- Write and run simulations

## Prerequisites


### PyPI
using pip, you can install `NumPy`,`Pandas`,`matplotlib`,`seaborn` with:
```shell
pip install numpy
```
```shell
pip install pandas
```
```shell
pip install matplotlib
```
```shell
pip install seaborn
```

## SUMMARY
To analyze a company’s supply chain, we need data on the different stages of the supply chain, like data about sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, inventory management, sales and customer demographics.

#### 1. Let’s get started with the task of Supply Chain Analysis by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset

```shell
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.io as pio
import plotly.graph_objects as go
pio.templates.default = "plotly_white"

data = pd.read_csv("supply_chain_data.csv")
print(data.head())
```

#### 2. Let’s have a look at the descriptive statistics of the dataset

```shell
print(data.describe())
```
![2](https://github.com/aniket3096/Supply_chain-analysis/assets/164318183/b2c173c9-0eaf-41e2-aa26-aa3bad44d223)

#### 3. let’s get started with analyzing the Supply Chain by looking at the relationship between the price of the products and the revenue generated by them

```shell
fig = px.scatter(data, x='Price', 
                 y='Revenue generated', 
                 color='Product type', 
                 hover_data=['Number of products sold'], 
                 trendline="ols")
fig.show()
```
![3](https://github.com/aniket3096/Supply_chain-analysis/assets/164318183/2f195828-8a74-4840-b82d-33204bdfa213)

#### Thus, the company derives more revenue from skincare products, and the higher the price of skincare products, the more revenue they generate

#### 4.Now let’s have a look at the sales by product type

```shell
sales_data = data.groupby('Product type')['Number of products sold'].sum().reset_index()

pie_chart = px.pie(sales_data, values='Number of products sold', names='Product type', 
                   title='Sales by Product Type', 
                   hover_data=['Number of products sold'],
                   hole=0.5,
                   color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Pastel)
                   
pie_chart.update_traces(textposition='inside', textinfo='percent+label')
pie_chart.show()
```
![4](https://github.com/aniket3096/Supply_chain-analysis/assets/164318183/19d3e5a0-aa6b-417d-960d-96e41cd193bd)

#### So 45% of the business comes from skincare products, 29.5% from haircare, and 25.5% from cosmetics

#### 5.let’s have a look at the total revenue generated from shipping carriers

```shell
total_revenue = data.groupby('Shipping carriers')['Revenue generated'].sum().reset_index()
fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=total_revenue['Shipping carriers'], 
                     y=total_revenue['Revenue generated']))
fig.update_layout(title='Total Revenue by Shipping Carrier', 
                  xaxis_title='Shipping Carrier', 
                  yaxis_title='Revenue Generated')
fig.show()
```

#### So the company is using three carriers for transportation, and Carrier B helps the company in generating more revenue.

#### 6. let’s have a look at the Average lead time and Average Manufacturing Costs for all products of the company

```shell
avg_lead_time = data.groupby('Product type')['Lead time'].mean().reset_index()
avg_manufacturing_costs = data.groupby('Product type')['Manufacturing costs'].mean().reset_index()
result = pd.merge(avg_lead_time, avg_manufacturing_costs, on='Product type')
result.rename(columns={'Lead time': 'Average Lead Time', 'Manufacturing costs': 'Average Manufacturing Costs'}, inplace=True)
print(result)
```

``` shell
Analyzing SKUs
```
#### SKU stands for Stock Keeping Units. They’re like special codes that help companies keep track of all the different things they have for sale. You give each toy a unique code, like a secret number only the store knows. This secret number is called SKU.

#### 7. let’s analyze the revenue generated by each SKU

```shell
revenue_chart = px.line(data, x='SKU', 
                        y='Revenue generated', 
                        title='Revenue Generated by SKU')
revenue_chart.show()
```
![7](https://github.com/aniket3096/Supply_chain-analysis/assets/164318183/e1d399b7-50d2-4fd3-8ad0-18fef4899cbf)

#### 8. let’s analyze the revenue generated by each SKU

 ```shell
stock_chart = px.line(data, x='SKU', 
                      y='Stock levels', 
                      title='Stock Levels by SKU')
stock_chart.show()
```
![8](https://github.com/aniket3096/Supply_chain-analysis/assets/164318183/0ce3a9f9-47b1-4d90-be50-bcbe4662829e)

#### 9.  let’s have a look at the order quantity of each SKU

 ```shell
order_quantity_chart = px.bar(data, x='SKU', 
                              y='Order quantities', 
                              title='Order Quantity by SKU')
order_quantity_chart.show()
```
![9](https://github.com/aniket3096/Supply_chain-analysis/assets/164318183/70d3834c-6b03-49ad-a353-337422d1ade4)

```shell
Cost Analysis
```
#### 10. let’s analyze the shipping cost of Carriers

 ```shell
shipping_cost_chart = px.bar(data, x='Shipping carriers', 
                             y='Shipping costs', 
                             title='Shipping Costs by Carrier')
shipping_cost_chart.show()
```
![10](https://github.com/aniket3096/Supply_chain-analysis/assets/164318183/42f4e8f7-e514-4c5d-8616-0e72088f998a)

#### In the above visualizations, we discovered that Carrier B helps the company in more revenue. It is also the most costly Carrier among the three.

#### 11. let’s have a look at the cost distribution by transportation mode

 ```shell
transportation_chart = px.pie(data, 
                              values='Costs', 
                              names='Transportation modes', 
                              title='Cost Distribution by Transportation Mode',
                              hole=0.5,
                              color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Pastel)
transportation_chart.show()
```
![11](https://github.com/aniket3096/Supply_chain-analysis/assets/164318183/b24fc15b-16a7-45b3-828d-9c748c43c235)

#### So the company spends more on Road and Rail modes of transportation for the transportation of Goods.

```shell
Analyzing Defect Rate
```
#### The defect rate in the supply chain refers to the percentage of products that have something wrong or are found broken after shipping.

#### 12. Let’s have a look at the average defect rate of all product types

 ```shell
defect_rates_by_product = data.groupby('Product type')['Defect rates'].mean().reset_index()

fig = px.bar(defect_rates_by_product, x='Product type', y='Defect rates',
             title='Average Defect Rates by Product Type')
fig.show()
```
![12](https://github.com/aniket3096/Supply_chain-analysis/assets/164318183/76135305-9362-4cc7-90f8-e8eeb6913877)

#### So the defect rate of haircare products is high.

#### 13. let’s have a look at the defect rates by mode of transportation

 ```shell
pivot_table = pd.pivot_table(data, values='Defect rates', 
                             index=['Transportation modes'], 
                             aggfunc='mean')

transportation_chart = px.pie(values=pivot_table["Defect rates"], 
                              names=pivot_table.index, 
                              title='Defect Rates by Transportation Mode',
                              hole=0.5,
                              color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Pastel)
transportation_chart.show()
```
![13](https://github.com/aniket3096/Supply_chain-analysis/assets/164318183/6f483052-b94e-4d74-a5eb-9eabc9d39264)

#### Road transportation results in a higher defect rate, and Air transportation has the lowest defect rate.

```shell
Conclusion
```

####  Supply Chain Analysis means analyzing various components of a Supply Chain to understand how to improve the effectiveness of the Supply Chain to create more value for customers.
